00:00:30,084 --> 00:00:31,792
There’s no signal.

3
00:00:31,834 --> 00:00:33,542
- Do you guys have signal?
- No.

4
00:00:33,584 --> 00:00:36,376
Relax. We’ll be there in half an hour.

5
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:39,459
Why did we call off Bali?

6
00:00:40,751 --> 00:00:43,834
This place doesn’t even exist on a map.

7
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:48,667
At least, we will appreciate what we have.

8
00:00:48,709 --> 00:00:49,917
Haqi.

9
00:00:49,959 --> 00:00:52,709
If you talk like an old man,

10
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,834
you won’t have friends at school.

11
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:56,834
You must be speaking from experience.

12
00:00:57,709 --> 00:00:58,917
Excuse me?

13
00:00:59,167 --> 00:01:02,667
I have lots of Instagram followers.

14
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,417
How many do you have?

15
00:01:05,709 --> 00:01:08,292
You only have 200. I have a billion.

16
00:01:08,334 --> 00:01:10,542
Hey, I’ve told you this before.

17
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:14,001
The man who raised me at the orphanage is very ill now.

18
00:01:14,042 --> 00:01:17,334
That’s why we planned to visit him.

19
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:20,417
So you should know that not everyone has parents.

20
00:01:20,459 --> 00:01:21,751
Look at your dad,

21
00:01:21,792 --> 00:01:23,959
Even without parents he has a strong fighting spirit.

22
00:01:24,001 --> 00:01:26,751
You should have that same spirit.

23
00:01:26,792 --> 00:01:29,792
Then why didn’t you just adopt us?

24
00:01:32,626 --> 00:01:34,084
I think it’s time.

25
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:37,209
They’re big enough to know.

26
00:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,167
Know what?

27
00:01:44,709 --> 00:01:47,167
We’re not your real parents.

28
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:51,126
We adopted you all when you were little.

29
00:01:57,459 --> 00:02:01,917
Oh no, so you’re taking us back to the orphanage?

30
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:11,292
Just kidding, Haqi!

31
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:13,834
- We’re kidding.
- It’s a joke.

32
00:02:13,876 --> 00:02:15,667
I’m fine if I’m adopted.

33
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:17,667
Aww, my baby Haqi.

34
00:02:17,709 --> 00:02:21,584
But it makes sense since Haqi doesn’t look like any of us.

35
00:02:21,626 --> 00:02:24,084
Hey, Haqi is my most handsome son.

36
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:26,334
Dina, don’t say that.

37
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:28,292
Your grandmother once said I wasn’t pretty,

38
00:02:28,334 --> 00:02:30,084
and until now I don’t feel pretty.

39
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:32,417
But Mom, if you keep telling someone that they’re pretty,

40
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,501
they will end up being overconfident like Dina!

41
00:02:34,542 --> 00:02:37,626
Shut up! You’re overconfident!

42
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:39,417
- You think you’re so pretty.
- I am!

43
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:40,167
You--

44
00:02:41,459 --> 00:02:42,126
Ouch!

45
00:02:44,709 --> 00:02:45,667
What was that?

46
00:02:48,709 --> 00:02:50,542
Is everybody okay?

47
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:08,126
- Haqi.
- I wanna see.

48
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,667
Just wait in the car.

49
00:03:10,542 --> 00:03:11,334
Dad!

50
00:03:17,042 --> 00:03:18,167
Nif, what was it?

51
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,584
Was it an animal?

52
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:22,917
Yes.

53
00:03:26,667 --> 00:03:27,626
A deer.

54
00:03:34,834 --> 00:03:35,667
Let’s go.

55
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:40,251
Get in.

56
00:04:38,167 --> 00:04:40,001
Go get the boxes.

57
00:04:40,626 --> 00:04:41,667
Okay.

58
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:42,751
Maman.

59
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:49,917
How are you?

60
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:53,084
Good.

61
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,167
How are you?

62
00:04:59,334 --> 00:05:00,167
Are you fine?

63
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:02,084
Yes, thankfully.

64
00:05:02,876 --> 00:05:04,334
This is my wife.

65
00:05:04,376 --> 00:05:05,251
Nadya.

66
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:06,542
Maman.

67
00:05:07,126 --> 00:05:07,834
Haqi.

68
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:08,959
Maman.

69
00:05:09,584 --> 00:05:11,251
This is Sandi and Dina.

70
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:13,709
It’s been ages.

71
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,542
Yes, it’s been very long.

72
00:05:16,584 --> 00:05:18,209
Haven’t been here in a while.

73
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,292
- This is Siti.
- Siti?

74
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:25,917
- My wife.
- Oh.

75
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:31,792
Hanif, Siti.

76
00:05:32,917 --> 00:05:34,042
How are you?

77
00:05:35,917 --> 00:05:36,876
Nadya.

78
00:05:40,209 --> 00:05:41,084
Haqi.

79
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:46,876
What happened to your face?

80
00:05:46,917 --> 00:05:48,126
Shush. Don’t be rude.

81
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:50,834
This is Dina and Sandi.

82
00:05:50,876 --> 00:05:52,876
We’ve got some gifts from Jakarta.

83
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,792
It’s for the children, Man.

84
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:57,209
Thank you, Sir.

85
00:05:57,917 --> 00:06:00,709
I’ll bring them inside. Let’s go inside.

86
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,584
Come on.

87
00:06:10,709 --> 00:06:11,917
Thank God.

88
00:06:14,251 --> 00:06:15,459
- Nif!
- Ton.

89
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,042
Nadya.

90
00:06:18,417 --> 00:06:19,042
How are you?

91
00:06:19,084 --> 00:06:20,334
You good?

92
00:06:20,667 --> 00:06:21,751
Yeah, great.

93
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:23,667
Hanif!

94
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:24,459
Bro.

95
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:25,251
Hi, Nad.

96
00:06:25,292 --> 00:06:26,542
Good to see you man.

97
00:06:26,584 --> 00:06:29,167
- You keep getting bigger?
- You too.

98
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,084
How have you been?

99
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:34,542
Hi, how are you?

100
00:06:34,584 --> 00:06:36,209
- Haqi.
- Hello!

101
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:37,251
Hi, beautiful.

102
00:06:37,917 --> 00:06:38,876
Hello.

103
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:40,042
Hi.

104
00:06:40,917 --> 00:06:41,542
Hi.

105
00:06:45,334 --> 00:06:46,126
Lets go in.

106
00:06:46,376 --> 00:06:47,126
Let’s go.

107
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:49,584
- Honey?
- Hm?

108
00:06:50,417 --> 00:06:51,292
Alright.

109
00:06:54,084 --> 00:06:55,626
Auntie, you have a cold?

110
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,542
Come here, fist bump.

111
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:10,001
There’s no signal.

112
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:12,834
Stop using your phone.

113
00:07:15,751 --> 00:07:17,251
We’re here again.

114
00:07:20,167 --> 00:07:21,792
This time with friends.

115
00:07:23,251 --> 00:07:24,084
Maman.

116
00:07:24,584 --> 00:07:25,917
- Anton.
- How are you?

117
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,042
Good.

118
00:07:27,917 --> 00:07:29,542
- Maman.
- Jef.

119
00:07:31,876 --> 00:07:32,584
Maman.

120
00:07:33,542 --> 00:07:35,126
Where are all the kids?

121
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:37,709
Two of them are here, Sir.

122
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:39,959
The rest have gone on a trip by bus.

123
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,251
They will be home tonight.

124
00:07:41,292 --> 00:07:43,459
Why are you calling me ’Sir’?

125
00:07:46,459 --> 00:07:47,376
Sorry, Nif.

126
00:07:51,292 --> 00:07:52,626
Hasbi, Rani.

127
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:54,084
This is Uncle Hanif.

128
00:07:54,792 --> 00:07:55,792
Hello.

129
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:57,042
Hasbi.

130
00:07:57,417 --> 00:07:58,334
Rani.
